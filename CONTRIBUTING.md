# Contributing to Build Your Own X

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively.

## What We're Looking For

We welcome tutorials that help developers learn by building technologies from scratch. Here's what makes a good contribution:

### ‚úÖ What We Accept
- **Step-by-step tutorials** that guide learners through building something from scratch
- **Well-structured articles** that break down complex topics into digestible parts
- **Code repositories** with clear documentation and progressive commits
- **Video tutorials** that provide clear explanations (marked with [video])
- **Educational content** that teaches underlying principles, not just API usage

### ‚ùå What We Don't Accept
- Framework documentation or API guides
- Tutorials that primarily glue existing libraries together
- Commercial content or promotional material
- Broken links or outdated resources
- Duplicate submissions (check existing entries first)

## Submission Guidelines

### Before Submitting
1. **Check for duplicates**: Search the README to ensure your tutorial isn't already listed
2. **Verify the link**: Make sure the tutorial is accessible and well-maintained
3. **Choose the right category**: Pick the most appropriate category from our list

### How to Submit

   - Tutorial URL
   - Category (select one)
3. **Wait for review**: Our maintainers will review your submission

### Writing Style Guidelines
- **Language format**: `[**Language**: _Title_](URL)`
- **Video indicator**: Add `[video]` at the end for video content
- **Alphabetical order**: Tutorials within each category are sorted alphabetically by language
- **Consistent formatting**: Follow existing patterns in the README

## Quality Standards

### Tutorial Quality
- **Clear learning path**: Should guide readers step-by-step
- **Working code**: Examples should be functional and tested
- **Good explanations**: Should explain the "why" behind implementation decisions
- **Appropriate level**: Should match the complexity of the topic

### Link Standards
- **Accessibility**: Must be publicly accessible (no paywalls or registration required)
- **Stability**: Prefer content from established sources
- **Freshness**: Recent tutorials are preferred, but classic resources are also valued

## Review Process

1. **Initial screening**: We check if the submission meets basic criteria
2. **Quality review**: We evaluate the tutorial's educational value
3. **Integration**: Approved tutorials are added to the appropriate section
4. **Feedback**: We provide feedback on rejected submissions when possible

## Language Distribution

We aim for diversity in programming languages. While popular languages like JavaScript, Python, and C++ are well-represented, we especially welcome tutorials in:

- Less common languages (Rust, Go, Elixir, etc.)
- Functional languages (Haskell, F#, Clojure, etc.)
- System languages (C, Assembly, Zig, etc.)
- Emerging languages

## Maintenance

### Reporting Issues
- **Broken links**: Report via GitHub issues
- **Outdated content**: Suggest alternatives or updates
- **Categorization errors**: Help us improve organization

### Community Guidelines
- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on educational value
- Help maintain quality standards
